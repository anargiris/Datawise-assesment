# App notes

### I will be sharing some notes and decisions that I took for the sake of this project

1. I will be using the App.js for rendering the page since this is a 1 page assesment. I will not be utilising libraries such as React-Router.

2. I implemented a fake API call functionality in the features list section to display a case of dynamic content rendering.

3. I have added some more breakpoints for the hero section since it didn't scale well at laptop screens (which I used to implement this assesment)

4. For the hero image, I downloaded the 3 vector files and tried to replicate it.

5. I have added some color animations on the buttons and underline animations on the Navbar links
